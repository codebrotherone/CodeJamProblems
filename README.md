# CodeJam Challenge
A practice repo to implement past code jam problems. Each directory in this
repo will be organized to reflect past problem sets.

Example repo structure.

    root/
        ProblemA_Round3_2017/
            readme.md
            main.py

The goal of this project will be to catalog and track my submissions for past
contests.
